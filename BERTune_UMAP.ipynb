        "\n",
        "> What is the relationship between [HDBSCAN](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) settings and topic cluster creation in [BERTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html)? This is the basic issue addressed below. In modeling a straight forward, homogeneous corpus of 30,000 English language news articles this notebook explains and shows dramatic improvements in the creation of a topic model. While the specific settings for this corpus will necessarily be different than for another corpus, the hope is that the discrete, reproduceable steps demonstrated here can be used to solve a wide-range of similar issues with many different corpi.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **The Corpus**\n",
        "\n",
        "> The [documents used here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danrobinson707/newsdf) are from a [larger publicly available dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishcscode/all-news-articles-from-home-page-media-house) on Kaggle. The articles are a collection of news stories from a handful of major English language news publications. The predominant sources seem to be from the U.S., England and Australia. There is a mix of human interest, politics, science, medical, sports, entertainment and other typical, general audience subjects. The vast majority of articles are 500-1500 words in length. There is a long-tail of article sizes but only 0.84 percent (252) are more than 3000 words long. A small handful of the articles are in Welsh, not English.\n",

        "\n",
        "## **This Notebook**\n",
        "\n",
        "> This notebook is divided into four parts. \n",
        "\n",
        "* **Setup** installs, imports, defines some utility procedures, switches into the default dir, and reads two csv files into DataFrames. These are documents used throughout.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **BERT_ALL** creates a single BERTopic model from all 30,000 articles.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **BERT_1** and **BERT_2** are splits of the corpus **BERT_ALL** created because the results of experimenting with the parameters led the author to believe that a single parameterized HDBSCAN was insufficient for modeling this particular set of data. See below for details.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **The Scatterplots**\n",
        "\n",
        "> For each dataset there is a scatterplot that is a 2D TSNE reduction of the default BERTopic, 5D UMAP reduction of the underlying BERT embeddings. The scatterplots are a critical tool in evaluating the results of a particular configuration. Each datapoint represents one document and the hover text shows the first 400 characters of the modeled article. TSNE was used because it provides a somewhat more visually interpretable/coherent view of the data than UMAP provides in this case. The topic assignments are projected onto the scatterplot and the user can easily see a spatial relationship between  documents and categorizations. \n",
        "\n",
        "> These visualizations seem to invite close inspection as they provide a clearer and possibly unique view as to how the clustering effects document categorization. \n",
        "\n",
        "## **A Note On Randomness**\n",
        "\n",
        "> Of course many of the underlying algorithms are stochastic in nature. In practice during the preparation of this notebook multiple itterations of all of the techniques - either amalgamated within BERTopic or the independent components: UMAP, HDBSCAN, PacMAP, TSNE - were run many times. While small differences were observed from run to run they were minor and were not deemed relevant for the discussion at hand. The reader is encouraged to do their own investigations if they are curious about these issues.\n"

Yet by zooming around the cluster and examining specific large and small visually clustered groupings, it is apparent that there is internal structure - articles about earthquakes, crime, sexual-abuse, movies, internet companies, etc. etc. grouped around one another. While there *seem* to be some outliers, there are really very few. Furthermore, closer inspection of the entire article may reveal clues as to why these articles were positioned as they were.\n",
